# GatePass — HOA-Controlled Contractor Marketplace

**Purpose**: HOA-first permission layer between homeowners and contractors. PMC transition workflows and compliance memory get GatePass into communities; contractor access and community revenue share are the marketplace business.

**Type**: app

**Status**: active — GatePass is the primary summer lane. Current focus: investor-readiness, first paid HOA pilot, Austin contractor marketplace launch path for the Aug. 22–23 Home Show.

## What It Does

GatePass is the board-owned operating layer and contractor-access gate for HOA communities. It starts by helping boards move away from poor PMC control through transition intake, compliance memory, and day-to-day operating modules. The bigger business is the controlled-access marketplace: the HOA is the gatekeeper, GatePass is the gate, contractors pay to pass through, and HOAs/homeowners can earn on transactions.

**Positioning (post stress test):** Lead with Trust/compliance moat, not feature count. The asymmetric advantage is L3 Trust → L8 Memory — every violation, vote, ARC decision, and financial action stored permanently in an immutable, exportable compliance ledger. PMCs cannot match this. No other HOA software owns this layer.

**Strategic layer (Supply Chain of Intelligence):**
- Primary today: L5 Workflows
- Asymmetric advantage: L3 Trust → L8 Memory (Compliance Memory Layer — now built)
- Trajectory: CONSOLIDATES — fragmented PMC market, no dominant self-management alternative
- Moat: compliance records + vendor history + permit trails with legal/financial consequence

**GTM Wedge:** Target HOAs with PMC dissatisfaction and record/control pain. These communities enter through transition safety, compliance memory, and board-owned operations. Transition credits or recoverable support may be used case-by-case, but do not promise universal contract buyouts or guaranteed cancellation-fee coverage. Current strategic source: `.memory/gatepass/marketplace-fundraise-war-room-2026-06-24.md`.

**Moat posture (May 29/30, 2026):** Public HOA/PMC/review data is **not** the moat; it is the acquisition wedge. The uncopiable layer is the **Transition Intelligence Graph**: private PMC contract facts, board-specific switching fears, stakeholder stances, objection patterns, transition triggers, Exit Pack proof artifacts, and downstream Compliance Memory. Investor-safe line: GatePass turns every PMC exit into structured transition memory.

**Demo data boundary:** Public demo pages may use explicit static “Demo data” fallbacks for the Steiner Ranch board demo when production has no seeded HOA records. Do not seed fake production HOA records just to make the demo look active, because production metrics should remain honest real-record counts.

**Naming note:** "GatePass" risks triggering visitor management / access control mental model. Acknowledged liability — positioning copy leads with compliance/governance, not gate/access.

## Transition Intelligence Graph

New app surface: **Moat → Transition Graph**.

Demo entry: `/demo?view=transition` opens the board demo directly on the Transition Graph surface for investor/operator review.

Purpose: make GatePass more uncopiable starting with the first board conversation. Every prospect should become structured data, even before close.

What it captures:
- **PMC Exit Intake** — current PMC, source signal, complaint themes, contract status, board fear, next step.
- **Board Psychology Map** — stakeholder role, stance, primary concern, persuasion angle.
- **Moat Signals** — board objections, private contract facts, PMC failures, switching triggers, compliance risks, proof artifacts, and case-study metrics.
- **Scoring** — exit readiness, data completeness, and hard-to-copy / replicability score.
- **Pilot Proof Pack** — JSON export combining transition memory + compliance summary + first-pilot proof checklist.

Strategic rule: do not claim the scraped lead database is proprietary. Claim the transition graph becomes proprietary only after GatePass engages boards and captures private transition facts competitors cannot scrape.
